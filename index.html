  <p> 
    A food desert is an area where access to affordable, nutritious food is limited or nonexistent due to the absence of nearby grocery stores, supermarkets, or other sources of fresh food. These areas are often characterized by a lack of fresh fruits, vegetables, and other whole foods, which are typically available at full-service grocery stores.
